          <h3>Exposure to Light:</h3>
          <p>Direct sunlight will damage any photos taken. This means the best location to store them,
              is in a dark space where they will not be damaged by the same light that can damage our own skin.
              Even if they are stored well in a dark room, there is always a possibility of yellowing in the lighter areas
              of the photo.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="steps">
          <h3>Do not cut:</h3>
          <p>It may be tempting to cut the photo to fit in certain frames, but never do this. It can damage them and cause them to deteriorate even faster.
              Not only this, but there are chemicals that could cause damage to your own skin because the chemicals inside a Polaroid are toxic.
              You can still take other measures to preserve them after cutting, but it will not look the same and the damage will most likely already
              be done.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="card2">
        <div class="steps">
          <h3>Complete Dry Out / Pre-Storage:</h3>
          <p>Before finding somewhere for your photos, you will need to let them dry for several weeks. The recommended time frame is up to 30 days.
            This is to allow the chemical processes to halt so you won’t damage it further by touching the photo. When you do handle to the photos, make sure you are cautious about where you hold them.
            Try to only hold the corner with clean hands or you may damage them with the oil on your hands. The best place to store them is a photo album made specifically for instant film.
            These are usually the best quality to preserve them safely while preventing any damage some albums may cause depending on their materials.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="steps">
          <h3>Proper Storage Location:</h3>
          <p>This may not be as simple as placing them in a box in the attic, specifically due to temperature and other variables.
            Instant film can not be stored in an area with high humidity or extreme temperature changes. The best place to store them is most likely in a closet that is on the main floor.
            Somewhere that is still dark, but has a consistent temperature. Make sure wherever they are put, that they are flat.
            Sitting them sideways can make them yellow faster than if they stay flat. </p>
